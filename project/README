Because of the I/O functionality of the project, a few specific requirements
in the source tree for our project must be maintained. If folders are set up
incorrectly, don't exist, or are in the wrong place, the programs will
not run correctly. The files should be correct in the .zip file, but just
in case, the correct source tree set up is found below:

SOURCE TREE

Within the main directory: code/
	black/
	cascades/
    Developmental_Code/
	eye_result/
	haar_result/
	images/
	build_all.sh
	run_project.sh
	Makefile
	compare.cpp
	eyedetect.cpp
	haardetect.cpp

Within the directory: cascades/
	haarcascade_eye.xml
	haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

Within the directory: images/
	aaron.bmp
	bobby.bmp
	darkerFace.bmp
	darkerFace2.bmp
	eye.bmp
	eye2.bmp
	eyes.bmp
	eyes2.bmp
	hikari.bmp
	lighterFace.bmp
	tj.bmp

Within the directory: Developmental_Code/
	black/
	images/
	build_all.sh
	eyedetect_beta.cpp
	ffill.cpp
	looping.cpp


Within the directory: Developmental_Code/images/
	black.bmp
	eye.bmp

Please Note!!!!: The following directories should start empty, but they must 
exist so that the program can write to them (and subsequently read from them)

	black/
	eye_result/
	haar_result/
	Developmental_Code/black/

COMPILING
In order to compile all of the files necessary for the project, go into the 
main directory: 
“code/”, and run “./build_all.sh”. This will run the bash script that compiles
all .cpp files (which all of our files are).  This will compile “compare.cpp”,
“eyedetect.cpp”, and “haardetect.cpp”. You should also go into the 
Developmental_Code directory (so you should be in the following:
“code/Developmental_Code/”) and run, again, “./build_all.sh”. This will compile
“eyedetect_beta.cpp”, “ffill.cpp”, and “looping.cpp”.

Please note: The programs within the “Developmental_Code/” directory are not 
the final project code. They have been included for reference in the decision 
process behind the code that went into the final project. The final project 
programs are “compare”, “eyedetect”, and “haardetect”.

Also please note: The "Developmental_Code/" directory is also found in the
"report/" directory for use in the design part of the report. The compiling
instructions are the same for both "Developmental_Code/" directories, as they
are identical.

RUNNING PROGRAMS
Once the code has been compiled, go to the main directory 
(“code/”) and run the “run_project.sh” bash script on an image to run the eye 
detection on it.

Because all of the images are bitmaps, (we chose to use bitmaps because they
are easier to iterate through for the comparison function) and all the images
are contained within the same directory (“images/”) there was no need to 
require the path or file extension to be typed at the command line. Therefore,
for your convenience, we have made the command line calls to “./run_program.sh”
formatted to be the following.

If a picture has the following path: “images/file.bmp” the call to “run_project.sh” should be
“./run_project.sh file”

Correct Examples
./run_project.sh eye
./run_project.sh eyes2
./run_project.sh bobby

Incorrect Examples
./run_project images/eye.bmp
./run_project eyes2.bmp
./run_project images/bobby

The following are all the possible calls to run_project.sh (each of the images to run it)
	./run_project aaron
	./run_project bobby
	./run_project darkerFace
	./run_project darkerFace2
	./run_project eye
	./run_project eye2
	./run_project eyes
	./run_project eyes2
	./run_project hikari
	./run_project lighterFace
	./run_project tj
